<Purpose>
Clarify ambiguous requests with focused brainstorming, tradeoff comparison, and confirmation questions so blocking product and implementation policy is resolved before planning, while presenting the main comparison and decision summary in scan-friendly tables.

# brainstorm

Use this as the entrypoint when ambiguity can change architecture, scope, tooling, API contracts, product policy, UX, or delivery strategy.

## When to use

- Request is ambiguous: "add login", "make dashboard", "improve UX".
- Multiple approaches are plausible and tradeoffs matter.
- Library/framework/pattern choices need to be made.
- Business-rule, UX, validation, permission, or state behavior policy is missing.
- Acceptance criteria are missing or vague.
- The user wants clarification questions before committing to a plan.

## When not to use

- Request is already decision-complete with clear scope and acceptance criteria.
- Task is straightforward with no meaningful tradeoff.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze request

Identify what is clear vs unclear:

- Required outcomes and constraints
- Missing decisions
- Plausible architecture/library branches
- Missing product-policy decisions across data model, business rules, UX behavior, permissions, validation, state/error handling, and accessibility expectations

### 2. Gather local context

Read only what is needed:

- Relevant folders and files inferred from the request
- Repository folder structure to locate current boundaries and ownership
- Existing code, tests, docs, and UI behavior that can answer questions without user input
- `./.codex/` references only when they directly constrain this workflow

Do not assume or depend on `./.ai/` or any other external AI metadata directory.

### 3. Research latest information when needed

If technical choices depend on external facts (library/API/pattern changes), gather current information before asking for decisions.
If reliable research tooling is unavailable, state that clearly and ask the user to confirm assumptions.

### 4. Compare approaches (required)

Always present 2-3 options with tradeoffs when multiple viable policy or implementation directions exist.
Present this option comparison as a markdown table in the response.
For each option include:

- Pros
- Cons
- Risks
- Implementation cost

Then recommend one option with concise rationale (YAGNI, maintainability, delivery risk).

### 5. Ask confirmation-focused questions

Ask only unresolved high-impact questions.
Rules:

- Max 4 questions at once
- Questions must be actionable
- Do not ask what can be derived from local context
- Questions should help the user confirm scope and direction quickly
- Prioritize blocking policy ambiguity that would change the implementation plan, tests, or user-visible behavior
- If more than 4 blocking questions exist, ask them in rounds
- Prefer structured user-input tooling when available; otherwise ask concise plain-text questions

### 6. Produce decision snapshot (default)

Return a concise decision snapshot in the response:

- Confirmed choices
- Resolved blocking policies
- Deferred low-risk choices
- Key assumptions
- Recommended next step (`architect` or direct execution)

Present the decision snapshot as a markdown table in the response unless the user explicitly asks for another format.

Response formatting rules:

- Use markdown tables for the main option comparison and the default decision snapshot.
- Keep recommendation rationale outside the table as a short paragraph or a few bullets when needed.
- Keep confirmation-focused questions as a short numbered list so the user can reply quickly.
- Do not leave the main comparison or decision snapshot as plain bullet lists unless the user explicitly asks for a different format.

Do not create a requirements artifact by default.

### 7. Optional artifact export (only on explicit user request)

If and only if the user explicitly asks for a written artifact, export to:

- `./.codex/artifacts/brainstorm/{feature-name}.md`

Include:

- Background
- Goals
- Non-goals
- Scope
- Constraints
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Open questions and assumptions

### 8. Quality gate before handoff

Before handoff, confirm:

- No hidden assumptions remain
- No blocking policy ambiguity remains for the chosen planning scope
- Blocking questions are explicit when another clarification round is still needed
- Recommended next step is clear

### 9. Handoff to architect (when needed)

When planning is needed, provide:

1. Summary of confirmed decisions
2. Explicit defaults or deferred low-risk choices
3. Suggested planning scope boundaries

Do not hand off to `architect` while blocking policy ambiguity remains.

## Guardrails

- Do not write implementation plans or code.
- Do not skip approach comparison when meaningful tradeoffs exist.
- Do not hand off to `architect` with unresolved blocking policy ambiguity.
- Do not present the main option comparison or default decision snapshot only as loose bullet lists.
- Do not depend on `./.ai/` or other external AI metadata directories.
- Keep brainstorm-owned artifacts under `./.codex/`.
- If requirements are already clear, explicitly state skip reason and route to `architect` directly.
